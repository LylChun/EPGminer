To facilitate the analysis of EPG data, epgminer contains various functions for working with voltage time series data as well as ANA annotation files from manual annotation software. 

## Installation

To install, use the following code:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LylChun/epgminer")
```
## Example

One major utility of epgminer is to find the frequency of voltage data waveforms using the Fourier Transform.
