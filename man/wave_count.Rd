\title{Calculate the Count or number of each waveform}
\usage{
wave_count(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing three columns: time, volts, waveform.}
}
\value{
A tibble object containing a row per waveform instance and two
columns, waveform and count, is returned.
}
\description{
The function wave_count calculates the count of each waveform
type.
}
\details{
Labelled data is grouped by each waveform instance and the
unique instances of each waveform type are counted. The waveform type
'pd' independent of any splitting into subforms is calculated at the end.
As a result, the pd calculations  will appear all at the end of the table.
The subforms, pd1 and pd2, will appear in sequence.
